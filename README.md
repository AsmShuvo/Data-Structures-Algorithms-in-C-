# Heap Data Structure Notes

## Overview
- A *Heap* is a complete binary tree data structure.
- It is used in priority queues.

### Types of Heaps
- *Min Heap*: Every child value must be greater than or equal to its parent's value.
- *Max Heap*: Every child value must be less than or equal to its parent's value.

## Operations and Time Complexity
### Insertion
- *Process*: Insert a new value and adjust the heap.
- *Time Complexity*: 
  - Worst Case: O(log n)
  - Best Case: O(1)

### Deletion
- *Process*: Remove the last element and move it to the root, then adjust the heap.
- *Time Complexity*: O(log n)

### Searching
- *Time Complexity*: O(n)

## Example: Max Heap Insertion
- Initial Heap: [50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 16]
- Insert 60:
  - After Insertion and Adjustment: [60, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 16, 50]

## Example: Deletion from Max Heap
- Initial Heap: [50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 16]
- Delete 50:
  - Move last element (16) to root.
  - Adjust Heap: [30, 15, 20, 8, 10, 16]

## Notes
- Heaps are efficient for priority queue implementations.
- Adjusting the heap after insertion or deletion takes O(log n) time due to the height of the tree.
- Searching in a heap is linear O(n) as it is not designed for search operations.
